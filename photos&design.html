        <h2>Macrophotography of Jewelry</h2>
        <h4>Description Project</h4>
        <p>I had the opportunity to work with fellow students from NHL Stenden for a jewelry shop in Friesland. The client was a goldsmith who owned a shop.</p>
        <p>She wanted to have more online presence and more professionally taken photos, so the team of business students made her a plan and I was asked to take photos of her work.</p>

      <h4>As a Hobby</h4>
      <p>I took the initiative to practice my skills in my free time. That’s why, when there was good weather outside I took advantage of it.</p>
      <p>In addition, all of the photos and videos I have made were shot with Canon 90D or Canon 80D with different lenses ranging between 50mm and 300mm.</p>

      <h2>Social Media Designs </h2>
      <h4>Post I have made for the official ISA Instagram account</h4>
      <p>As part of the Marketing team of the International Student Association I had the task to run the Instagram account. One of my key responsibilities was to design promotional posters for upcoming events, such as social gatherings, workshops, and our major activities like game nights and charity tournaments. I then shared these materials through the Instagram platform, using captions, stories, and scheduling strategies to maximize visibility and participation .</p>
      <p>I remained on this position for the duration of my 2nd year at NHL Stenden,  contributing to the ISA's growth and helping foster a more connected and engaged international student network.</p>

        <h4> Presenting Reaserch in a readable way</h4>
        <p>The infographic on the left was created during the fourth semester of my studies. I had to create and display research into the marketing environment of a company. The finished version of the infographic highlights the marketing principles of the client me and my study group were developing products for – Banijai Benelux</p>
        <p>The infographic on the right was created during my second semester in Creative Business. We had our concept, which was a cooking show and every week we had a different task related to that. In week 17, we had to make an infographics so my task was to prepare interesting facts, to upload it to a shared document and make the final look with all of my peers’ facts. </p>

        <h2>Journal and Magazine </h2>
        <h4> The more cretive approach</h4>
        <p>In the beginning of my second semester at NHL I received my first ever design task. I had to make a magazine depicting me as an individual. It was mandatory to use Adobe Illustrator. Back then, it was my first time using Illustrator but I did everything by myself – from the design to the photos  </p>
        <p>As time progressed, new assignments arose. For one of them we had to develop an idea and deliver different media products each week for a couple of weeks. My idea was revolving around a mentally ill young girl who killed her brother. Since my first product was from 1st POV, I decided to make a journal to expose the character’s inner thoughts and to show how the illness took over time  . </p>

      <h4>Showing Places and Cuisine</h4>
      <p>At Creative Business, we also took a look at printed media. Thus, some of my tasks included developing travel brochures and menus for restaurants.</p>
      <p>It was encouraged to use the Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Illustrator. My work was a mix, and I used both Illustrator and Canva to create these brochures and menus.</p>
