  <h1 class="doc-title">Business</h1>
  <p class="doc-description">
    When I first started working with media business concepts (Level A), I was mainly following guidance and getting familiar with the basic tools and terms. As I moved to Level B, I began to work more independently—analyzing trends, thinking strategically, and applying business knowledge to realistic cases. By the time I reached Level C, I was able to confidently create well-supported advice and use business insights to help shape decision-making, just like in real business environments.

      <p class="doc-summary">In semester one we had a task to add value to the product (podcasts) of MediaHuis Noord (publishing company). In order to do that, first detailed analysis of their current situation had to be made. So, I was tasked with writing a report on that matter.  The report consists of the analysis of the blocks of the Business Model Now, the Marketing Mix and People, Purpose, and Structure. .</p>

      <p class="doc-summary">This document presents a concept I developed for Vice Media Group with the aim of increasing audience engagement and positioning their website as the primary platform for views. Through a structured design-based thinking approach, I conducted research, brainstormed ideas, and prototyped a unique solution called Chatbot the Mascot. The purpose of this project was to create an innovative, interactive tool aligned with Vice’s values and their target audience’s behavior, while also showcasing my skills in concept development and media strategy.</p>

      <p class="doc-summary">This document is a comprehensive business plan for Arkavika, a company I created that would help connect young creatives and media professionals, in order for the young people to create connections and find projects easily. Since the company was mine, I had to write the business plan from scratch while designing the company, unlike the previous times. I created the Mission and Vision, the KPIs, the Business Model Canvas I worked on the Porter’s Five Forces, the STP model, the T( technology)  from PESTEL, the Marketing Mix, the 7 S model, the CRM practices, part of the Stakeholder Analysis and Risk analysis, the Marketing proposition and Marketing Mix </p>

  <section class="doc-section green-bg" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h1 class="doc-title">Research</h1>
  <p class="doc-description">
    Research started out as a guided process for me in Level A, where I learned the steps and structure while getting used to different methods. In Level B, I took more control by designing my own research questions, collecting data, and choosing the right approach for the topic. By Level C, I was confidently conducting independent research, critically analyzing results, and presenting everything in a professional way that could be used in actual creative business practice.

      <h2>Level A</h2>
      <iframe src="images/Research_pol.pdf"></iframe>
      <p class="doc-summary">This was my first big research paper. My task was to first come up with the research question, prepare my interview questions (which were meant to answer the main RQ) and find a person who fits the criteria and is willing to give me their insights. After that, I had to code the data and turn it in.  In the final stage, we had to summarize the data and display it in a way that answered the research question.to create a research plan that would help me understand the topic better and gather relevant information.</p  >

      <p class="doc-summary">In the Design page Gowth Strategy infographic can be seen. The data in there came from a deep research of the market of the company. Firstly, each team member,  including me, had to look into theory to base the group concept on. Secondly, I had to do research on the Meso and Macroeconomics. Thirdly, I had to take part in the creation of a survey, which backed up the desk research. Finaly, from the findings I proposed a corparate strategy.   </p>

    <div class="doc-block">
      <h2>Level C</h2>
      <iframe src="images/Project Proposal Research in Profiles I  2324 (2).pdf"></iframe>
      <p class="doc-summary">I developed a full research proposal, including objectives, methodology, timeline, and analysis plan. I used Bandura’s self-efficacy theory and Bourdieu’s capital theory to frame the research and ensure academic depth. My findings helped validate the company's features. . This shows I can carry out relevant, theory-based research aligned with real organizational needs and  demonstrates my ability to apply research independently and effectively.</p>

 <!-- Section 1 - Beige  Marketing-->
  <section class="doc-section beige-bg" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h1 class="doc-title">Marketing</h1>
  <p class="doc-description">
    At the beginning (Level A), I was introduced to the basics of marketing and learned how to explore client needs with support from tutors. Moving into Level B, I became more comfortable doing things on my own—evaluating marketing strategies and building more thoughtful, data-informed plans. Level C challenged me to take it a step further, where I developed full strategic marketing plans that were both practical and professionally structured, just like those used in real campaigns.

      <h2>Level A</h2>
      <iframe src="images/mcpVADEFA.pdf"></iframe>
      <p class="doc-summary">This document showcases my initial understanding of marketing concepts and client needs analysis.My task was to describe the Campaign, the Channels and POEM. It was expected from me to develop a campaign that will promote the products we’ve created through different types of media such as radio, print, and online platforms</p>

      <h2>Level B</h2>
      <iframe src="images/Content marketing introduction campaign (1) (1).pdf"></iframe>
      <p class="doc-summary">Throughout this project, I demonstrated excellence in independently conducting research into the client's marketing environment using established models, highlighting and evaluating the client's strategic marketing principles, and designing a measurable, financially, and legally substantiated operational marketing plan. .</p>

      <h2>Level C</h2>
      <iframe src="images/Final Business Plan Arkavika (1).pdf"></iframe>
      <p class="doc-summary">Since the decisions that were made for the Marketing strategy of my company  were derived directly from the findings from the Business part, everything is in one document. For marketing, Arkavika gave me hands-on experience in identifying a unique value proposition and defining a target audience. I created marketing strategy that was grounded in consumer behavior theories and market trends. I also explored segmentation, positioning, targeting (STP model), and communication techniques that suited the niche Arkavika was aiming for. This shows I can work independently and critically apply marketing theory </p>
