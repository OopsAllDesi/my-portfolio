        <h2>Behind the Curtains of a theatre performace</h2>
        <h4>Description Project</h4>
        <p>During my time at NHL Stenden, I was an active member of the Creative Business theatre group Strange Land Theatre from my first year until my third year. Over the course of three successful productions—Fox on the Brain, How to Hold Your Breath, and The Welkin—I had the opportunity to be in different roles in the backstage departments. .</p>
        <p>In my first year, I joined the marketing department as a team member, contributing to promotional activities, social media content and designing the official logo, which is still used to this day. By my second year, I became a Co-Head of Marketing, where I led a diverse team in the execution of a marketing campaign, managed the group’s Instagram and offline presence. </p>
        <p>In my third year, I decided to explore a different direction and joined the costumes department, where I was responsible for sourcing and coordinating wardrobe props that aligned with the production’s vision. My contribution to all three shows, along with my versatility across departments, reflects my ability to collaborate, lead, and adapt in a creative environment.</p>

      <h2>Unity amongst diversity</h2>
      <h4>Description Project</h4>
      <p>During my second year of CB, I was an active member of ISA Leeuwarden (International Student Association), where I took on the roles of Secretary and Marketing Coordinator. ISA is a non-profit student-led organization founded in 2017, aimed at creating a welcoming and connected environment for international students in Leeuwarden, while also encouraging Dutch students to build international friendships.</p>
      <p>In my marketing role, I managed the association’s Instagram account, ensuring consistent content to promote our activities and events. I helped organize a variety of events such as movie nights, bowling evenings, casual get-togethers, workshops, and our most successful initiative — a charity volleyball tournament that brought students together to raise money for the Port Alfred soup kitchen.</p>
      <p>This experience strengthened my skills in communication, social media management, and event management. I had the opportunity to work in a diverse team and help other students integrate in Leeuwarden.</p>
      <p>Ps: The designs I have done can be seen in the <a href="photos&design.html" target="_blank">Photos & Design</a> page or on the Instagram account for ISA – isaleeuwarden</p>

        <h2>Guiding the new students</h2>
        <h4>Description Project</h4>
        <p>As part of NHL Stenden’s Study Start Week—a program designed to help new students integrate into university life—I became a Study Buddy for the February intake of Creative Business students. Together with another 3rd year student, I was responsible for guiding a group of newcomers through a series of fun activities meant to introduce them to the school, the city, and their study program.</p>
        <p>On the first day, we met our group and completed a photo bingo challenge, which involved capturing creative snapshots around campus based on a randomized list. Day two included ice skating and a presentation introducing students to the Creative Business program. On the third day, we were assigned a group challenge to recreate a music video within two days. Our team chose "I'm Just Ken" from the Barbie movie. I was the camera operator, and I filmed everything since we were only 6. The week ended with a final showcase event where each group presented their work. Our team  won the award for Best Choreography. </p>
        <p>This experience presented me with the opportunity to be a leader, pass down my knowledge and experience and once again be a camera operator/ director.   </p>
